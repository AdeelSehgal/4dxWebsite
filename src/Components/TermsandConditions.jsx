                <p className='text-[18px] text-[#858585] my-4 '>4.1 You may use the Services for any number of projects and scope for which you have subscribed under the applicable plan and as are appropriate based on the size of your account. While we accept unlimited requests for Deliverables and revisions to those Deliverables, our output volume depends on many factors, namely depending on the total request volume and complexity. We will do our best to work with you to accommodate any priority items and your timelines, but we suggest you do not use our Services for time-sensitive projects. <br /> <br />

                    ‍
                    4.2 We do our best to minimize any mistakes in the final Deliverables.

When we deliver a file to you, you agree to review and proof all files for any errors or omissions and notify us if any changes or corrections are needed within seven (7) days of receipt. We will do our best to rush edits to correct any mistakes that you notify us about during this time period.

                    ‍
                    4.3 The speed of your account is determined by how many subscriptions you have. A subscription is a measurement of output and represents what we can accomplish in a business day, with our team, our software, and our web platform.

                    (i) the type of plan;
                    (ii) the volume of requests;
                    (iii) the complexity of requests. We do not guarantee the amount of work that we can create with a single subscription. To increase the volume of work we can complete within a business day, we suggest you add subscriptions or add-ons to your account. <br /> <br />
